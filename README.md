A preview of WordPress Style Variations (colors & fonts) inside the Site Editor, with quick Select/Preview actions. Works even if the Theme Variation uses CSS variables.

## Description

WPWM Theme Variation Display lists available Style Variations for the active theme and renders a compact, variable‑accurate preview for each card:

- Stripe swatches for the variation’s palette colors with readable labels.
- Font samples pulled from the variation’s settings when available.
- Select or temporary Preview actions.

This helps theme authors and site builders evaluate multiple variations quickly without opening each one.

## Features

- Uses each variation’s own CSS variables for accurate color display.
- Contrast‑aware swatch labels (including semi‑transparent colors using RGBA) for legibility.
- Responsive card layout that wraps to your viewport.

> Note: This plugin does not modify your theme or content. It is a visual aid inside Appearance → Theme Variation Display.

My Color Palette Generator (https://wp-website-mastery.com/color-palette) generates Color Palettes as Theme Variations, with CSS light-dark().

The Color Palette Generator and Theme Variation Display plugins work together to create a complete solution for theme authors and site builders.

They are part of my upcoming course, "WordPress Websites: from Overwhelm to Mastery", at WP Website Mastery (https://wp-website-mastery.com).

## Installation

1. Upload the plugin folder to `/wp-content/plugins/wpwm-theme-variation-display/` or install via the Plugins screen.
2. Activate the plugin via the Plugins screen.
3. Open Appearance → Theme Variation Display.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does this change my theme settings?

No. It renders previews. “Select” applies the chosen variation via existing Site Editor APIs when available; “Preview (temporary)” does not save changes.

### Why do some palettes show fewer labels?

Only colors defined by the variation are displayed. Base theme colors that are not redefined are intentionally omitted to avoid confusion.

### Does it support transparent colors?

Yes. RGBA backgrounds are composited against the card background before text contrast is calculated.
